									<p>Here are the 3 test completed and analyzed thoroughly by myself and the summary is seen down below.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Myers-Briggs test</h2>
									<p>After completion of the Myers-Briggs test online, it has categorized my personality traits as an ENTJ Characteristics:The Executive.The questions are designed to assess the personality of testers by assessing their personality across four major areas: 1)Extraversion and Introversion, 2)Sensing and Intuition, 3) Thinking and Feeling and 4)Perceiving and Judging.</p>
									<p>The ENTJ Characteristics are normally extraverted, intuitive, logical thinking, and judging. After completing this test, I realised that I have constantly been practicing and applying the steps to becoming an entrepreneur. This result could bring prosperity among my team and its members because in order for a team to excel, the environment needs to be acceptable, therefore employees/team members can be more willing and creative.</p>

									<h2>Online Learning style test</h2>
									<p>After completion of the Online Learning style test on Educationplanner.org, it has shown that my learning style is more Tactile. The test have given me an insight on what a tactile learner is and why I am considered a tactile learner.</p>
									<p>Tactile learners understand and remember things through physical movement, meaning I am a more 'hands-on' learner as a tactile learner prefers to touch, move, build, or draw on taught knowledge, and can tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. In regards to my future behaviours in group projects, things that tactile learners such as myself can do to learn and cooperate with others is to do lots of hands-on activities like completing a design project for innovation, taking walks, or acting out stories. Constant fidgety food or toys such as chewing a gum or spinning a pen, is normally how tactile learners learn best. While forming a team, it is best to look for members that are the opposite of your own characterictics, because it can produce more ideas and feedbacks. </p>

									<h2>Big 5 Personality Test</h2>
									<p>Firstly, the big 5 personailities in the test are: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. After completion of the test, my personality trait scores are, high in Openness being 73% and low in Conscientiousness being 31%, which gives an average score of 58%.</p>
									<p>Openness describes an individual's tendency to think in complex, and abstract ways. </p>
