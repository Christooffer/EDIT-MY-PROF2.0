											<h1>Purpose<br />
											</h1>
											<p>Hello, my name is Fan Wai Hoe, and or Chris and I am from Malaysia.</p>
										</header>
										<p>I am currently majoring in business management in Melbourne, RMIT.  This is my 3rd year hoping to graduate of a bachelors degree and pursue my future goals and dreams. The reason to why I have chosen this course at RMIT is because I have always been interested in technological data and game designing. As I have been a gamer of all sorts ever since I was a kid and having to be constantly exposed to newer technologies in this evolving world, it is about my time and age to grasp the full knowledge of IT. The design and creativity of the building and courses have attracted my wants and needs, therefore I enrolled into RMIT. My future plans and goals after graduation is to operate an authentic korean restaurant available to all locals in Malaysia.</p>

												<h3>Automotive Business Manager</h3>
												<p>An ideal job of mine is becoming an automotive business manager. The position offered is a automotive finance specialist, which is appealing in all ways possible as it is a dream to be in a managerial position. The skills required to have are expereinces in lending and sales, tiredness fueling energy and positivity, demonstrating your honesty, integrity, and commitment to exceeding customer expectations. The skills and qualifications that I have aquired till now are of being somewhat of a quick learner, competitive with myself, and explorative in finding different ways in accomplishing things more efficiently. However, it may not be enough to suffice working as a manager with little to no qualifications and experiences in an automotive industry. Therefore, in becoming managerial fit, I plan to improve on my social communicating skills, improve of knowledge on the automotive industry, and practice having a positive mindset throughout working hours.</p>

												<h3>Game Design</h3>
												<p>In this day and age, individuals such as myself who was born into today's technological improving world have been exposed to large amounts of technology ever since I was a kid. IT was a very facinating thing to me as a kid, therefore I took interest into it while I was first introduced to it. My brother was the cause to my interest into IT as I got hooked into the visuals and appeals of a game. I was around the age of 10 when I was first introduced to what a game truly was. The competitive energy while playing the game was suprisingly addictive which was the main reason that peeked my interest. The reason I chose to come to RMIT was because of its convenience in the city and its business courses. I expect to learn to become more mature in the sense of knowledge, and to be more aware of my own abilities.    </p>
