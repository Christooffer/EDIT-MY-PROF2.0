										<h2 id="content">Overview</h2>
										<p>This project idea is going to be based of genuine innovations as we look to tackle the brains of everybody. It is an application available to users of any kind as it is an app that allows users to formulate songs imbeded in the thoughts of individuals. This app utilises all types of musical instruments for users to protrait any type of music in their thoughts into the app rendering it to formulate an assumption of the users thoughts.   </p>

												<h3>Motivation</h3>
												<p>This idea came up to me as a motivation to allow everyone to enjoy and create music together, even if the user has symptoms of being tone deaf. Congenital amusal, generally referred to as tonal deafness, refers to an abnormal musical disorder not resolved by prior brain lesion, hearing loss, cognitive disability, or lack of stimulation of the environment. This takes up to 4% of the worlds population for people with this type of disability. Furthermore, not only does this app appeal for individuals interested in music, it allows people with tone disabilities experience the true beauty of music.</p>

												<h3>Description</h3>
												<p>Ever had the moment in life where the melody of some type of music gets stuck in the head fairly easily, while on the other hand it is really difficult to describe or even play the melody out willingly. Unless an individual has perfect pitch, which is a person who is able to sing or hum any given pitch; that is, if they are asked to sing a B flat without hearing the said note, they can sing it without any hesitation. People with this is rarely found around the world as it is difficult to sing a said tone without hearing it, however, with the help of this new application that helps users develop a more active tone. It can be used as a gaming application where you can learn and slowly develop active tone through completing challenges and achievements. As well as while sleeping, users can attach earphones to activate the sleeping mode, where it develops the users active tone through the users learning phase while in deep sleep. Deep sleep occurs in Stage 3 of NREM sleep and of all the sleep stages, stage 3 is the most restorative and the sleep stage least likely to be affected by external stimuli. But how does the application get through to the user while he/she is in deep sleep? It is because of the brain waves as the waveform type in stage 3 is spindle waves and slow waves, it allows the user to be in a state of relaxation as well as knowledge storing. This can also occur during REM stages where the brain waves are more active leading to dreams that would allow creativity and habitual understanding of tones to mix and develop a type of melody.   </p>

												<h3>Outcome</h3>
												<p>The outcome that would come off if the project is successful is that anybody that uses the application will excel in a more active perfect pitch. After an estimate of around half a year, users of the application will greatly improve in their recognition of tones as well as improved picturing of the melody/tone. </p>
